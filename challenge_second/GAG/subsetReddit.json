{"created_utc":"1420070405","downs":0,"body":"#####&amp;#009;\n\n######&amp;#009;\n\n####&amp;#009;\n [**Brutalist architecture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist%20architecture): [](#sfw) \n\n---\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;__Brutalist architecture__ is a movement in architecture that flourished from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, descended from the [modernist architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture) movement of the early 20th century. The term does not derive from the word \"brutal\", but originates from the French *b\u00e9ton brut*, or \"raw concrete\", a term used by [Le Corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier) to describe his choice of material. [British architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_United_Kingdom) critic [Reyner Banham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reyner_Banham) adapted the term into \"brutalism\" (originally \"New Brutalism\") to identify the emerging style.\n\n&gt;Brutalism became popular with governmental and institutional clients, with numerous examples in Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the United States, Canada, Brazil, the Philippines, and Australia. Examples are typically massive in character (even when not large), [fortress-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification), with a predominance of exposed [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete) construction, or in the case of the \"brick brutalists\" ruggedly detailed brickwork and concrete together. There is often an emphasis on graphically expressing in the external elevations and in the whole-site plan the main functions and people-flows of the buildings. Brutalism became popular for educational buildings (especially university buildings), but was relatively rare for corporate projects. Brutalism became favoured for many government projects, high-rise housing, and [shopping centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall) to create an architectural image that communicated strength, functionality, and frank expression of materiality.\n\n&gt;In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of some 1930s and 1940s architecture. In one critical appraisal by Banham, Brutalism was posited not as a style at all but as the expression of an atmosphere among architects of moral seriousness. \"Brutalism\" as an architectural critical term was not always consistently used by critics; architects themselves usually avoided using it altogether. More recently, \"brutalism\" has become used in popular discourse to refer to buildings of the late twentieth century that are large or unpopular \u2013 as a synonym for \"brutal\" \u2013 making its effective use in architectural historical discourse problematic.\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/bk21nrm.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DHHS2_by_Matthew_Bisanz.JPG) - *Hubert H.

{"body":"Bugs I've noticed since the patch that really piss me off:\n\n* Clicking on a spawn location and either 1) spawning underground in a completely different location, 2) spawning in the middle of nowhere, 3) dropping out of the sky and falling to your death.. in the middle of nowhere.\n* Random invisible walls blocking shots when I have a clear line of sight. Happened twice yesterday when I was using the SAS-R. Once was under a bridge, and another while on a rooftop farming a sunderer. Both times I had nothing blocking my view, but when I fired, I would see sparks fly in front of me and hear the glass shattering sound effect that indicated I'd shot a wall. Wtf?\n* Severe server lag. I'm talking, dying to people after I've killed them. I also killed somebody with an EM6 after I had already died and switched loadouts to a GD7-F. Movement seems warpy, people moving extra fast. It feels as though the server is trying to \"catch up\" and suddenly moves the player models forward extra fast. \n* Been having the cloak glitch a lot. When infil, it gets stuck in this weird half-cloaked phase and I can't tell if I'm really cloaked or not. On HA, I occasionally get stuck glowing even when my shield is off.\n* Invisible people.

However the lower league sides have to go through many qualifying rounds until they eventually hit the First Round (which is called the First round proper) which is where the Leagues 1 and 2 sides enter. \n\nEventually they hit the 3rd round and that's where the Championship and PL sides automatically enter (so there are 64 teams in Third Round proper). \n\nMatches that end in a draw are replayed about two weeks later at the away sides ground (example, United vs Arsenal ends 1-1 at Old Trafford the replay is at the Emirates) and if there is another draw it goes to extra time and penalties. \n\nUnlike the League Cup there is no two legged semi final. The semi final is played at Wembley with the final also played at Wembley. \n\nLong post but there you go. The League Cup isn't taken as seriously by bigger teams (hence why Sunderland, Swansea, Bradford, Cardiff and Birmingham have been finalists in the last 4 years) but the FA Cup is always regarded as the best cup competition in the world due to its rich history.

I do feel I owe it to myself to try these and some other vendors, at the same time I feel like 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' and everything seems to be working well:)  I do enjoy seeing y'all recommending and promoting each other around these parts and hearing tell of your positive actions in the ecr and larger vaping community.

The biggest irritation to me was PLA leaking from the hotend, but a fan duct printed and installed that put airflow across the heat sink on the head fixed the issue.\n\nYou can see from most of the comments already that the theme with the TAZ is frustration yet in the end they're glad they went with it.  Once you do find the sweet spot though it's a beast of a printer that has no problems printing 24/7.  In fact Lulzbot prints 24/5 with over a hundred of them.  As /u/jebba said in another thread there's a new all metal hotend very close to production likely about the same time as their new mini printer.  I'm sure the TAZ 5 will have the improvements such as the self leveling system and new hotend.\n\nI can't say anything really bad about Makerbot's 2/2x.  They have their own issues but once you work on them a bit they're solid workhorses.  The 5th gens... stay away for now.\n\nMakerGear M2 is a really solid printer.  I know a few people who own them and if you look at 3dhub's guide the printer is very well liked.\n\nA printer I would highly suggest is an Ultimaker 2.  It has a smaller build volume than the TAZ but it's far less picky with settings.  It's my first choice when printing most of the time just because it works with minimal fuss and can print faster at the same quality levels.  With ninjaflex and composite ninjaflex/ABS parts the TAZ wins hands down though.\n\nIf you can accept the build volume the Flashforge Creator Pro is a nice choice and very well built.  Any part that has a higher potential failure rate is easy to replace and spares are on their site.  It doesn't hold your hand when it comes to documentation though.","subreddit":"3Dprinting","parent_id":"t3_2qxrrr","controversiality":0,"edited":1420070604,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rk5q","retrieved_on":1425124279,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":"","gilded":0,"author_flair_text":"Lulzbot TAZ 4, Ultimaker 2, Flashforge Creator Pro"}

If you parse in the latest extreme dungeons, WHM is consistently way higher dps than sch if both are being played optimally.  My runs have also finished minutes faster than compared with skilled SCH's in game.  If I wasn't at work I'd share some of the parses given to me by people running them during the tests; but I'm sure if you did the same tests you'd get similar numbers and times.  The best new dungeon to speed run is Qarn imho.  The worst being Snowcloak (due to constant forced stops).\n\nAnd while I'm not saying it's impossible, I never saw a group with SCH instead of WHM clear faster than 10-11 minutes in WP back then.

So, the result of that is that this CPU is going to just sit there and go to waste, while the video card will be huffing and puffing, straining at the seams.\n\nDrop the CPU down to a non-overclock i5-4460 or 4590, and bump the video card up to at least a Radeon R9 280 or 280X, and you'll be playing every modern-day game at a smooth 60 FPS on High/Ultra settings -- for nearly the same price. If you stick with the build you have already chosen for yourself, you'd be lucky if you got 30-40 FPS on High, and some of the newer games will need to be bumped down to Medium to stay above 30-40 (which is a minimum, by any PC gaming standard). Of course the fact that you don't have a 1080p monitor is certainly going to help you reach higher framerates, but do you really want to limit yourself like that? Surely at some point you'll want a better monitor (they're only about $120-130 for a high-quality IPS LED), and your hardware won't be able to keep up with it.\n\nIf your intention is to play video games on this PC, you're making a big mistake. I urge you to heed my advice on how to allocate your resources for better overall performance.

These abilities on the enemy are in my opinion a great addition to the game. I've been running massive amounts of T4 missions recently because of how insanely fun it has become. However, this is also because I have high RoF weapons in my T4 load out. The nullifiers and eximi shields need to follow the rules placed onto player controlled Globes. This means, explosive munitions I.e. Penta nades, Ogris rockets or blast procs need to affect the enemies within the shield as they do on players. Or conversely players should finally be immune to procs coming from outside the globe and into it. \r\rAnother thing DE should consider is removing the damage limit on shields. Its pretty ridiculous how high RoF weapons are better against Nullifier shields (I've noticed this is only on Nullifiers) that slow high damage weapons. To put this into perspective, my Boltor Prime shoots spikes that deal ~800 damage to the nullifier shields. My opticor deals 8640 damage to the shields yet it always takes around a full opticor mag, 5 shots (~9 shots with multishot) to take the shield down. DE needs to remove the damage limit the shields can take from one damage source allowing the viability of both high RoF and slow RoF weapons to be viable.\r\rAn idea I've been tinkering with is to make the shields susceptible to weapon procs. Blast procs can CC enemies inside the shield while Magnetic procs can deal more damage to the shield itself. By introducing this mechanic, Void missions become more dynamic as players have to choose when and where to switch weapons.\r\r\rTL;DR 1) unify rules with regard to out of body shields. Players should be able to affect enemies in shield or be immune to them inside their own.\r\r2) Remove damage limit on shields to make slow RoF weapons viable against nullifiers.\r\r3) Add elemental weaknesses to the shields, bringing more variety to weapon elemental choices in the void.","distinguished":null,"id":"cnas9hy","archived":false,"score":2,"author":"kanmax92","subreddit":"Warframe","parent_id":"t3_2qvuwv","retrieved_on":1425124278,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"author_flair_text":null,"controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2urg0","edited":false}

All the cards you mentioned are no doubt key in control, but 5 additional cards, 5 turns when you're not taking fatigue, seems absolutely insane to me. Also, this card only get better in time as more cards that interact with Secrets and have Mad Scientist-esque effects into the game. I'd gladly agree that no one would ladder with this card, but I think against control it could be insanely useful.\n\nI think Shadow Summoner doesn't produce an insane amount of burn at all; you pay 9 mana just to get the first Shadow Bomber on board (6 for the card, 2 for hero power, 1 for the Bomber), and you can only Hero Power once per turn. If you have pressure to go along with it, then yes, it will do work, but on its own I don't think it's that strong at all.\n\nFor Tinkerer, I imagined this card less as a Jeeves (who simply allows any class to be zoo) and more like a mini-Gazlowe. I think if you even have two cards on board that generate Spare Parts (like a Gnome and Yeti) and you trade them in, this card gives you value. Two extra Spare Parts with Gazlowe or Antonidas or even Auctioneer is really good, and you're not paying too much to get them. \n\nBeastmaster can have synergy with Hunter cards obviously, allowing you to Houndmaster anything, enable Kill Command, etc. etc. This can let you do stuff like turn 4 Yeti turn 5 Beastmaster + Houndmaster, or turn 3 Harvest Golem turn 4 coin Beastmaster Houndmaster; basically it allows a work-around for there being a low number of good beasts in the game. It also synergizes with Druid of the Fang, I don't know if that's enough to make Beast Druid viable but I think it's worth considering. And, the most important part for me, it is a vastly superior Black Knight + Mark of the Wild with Hemet Nesingwary; a 6 mana Assassinate that also summons a 6/3 and a 2/1. \n\nGenerator is insane if you can get value from it, but you have to run the Paladin secrets in exchange, which are pretty mediocre. And they won't get amazing value with the board state, except for Avenge; Redemption will be bad if they kill the Generator, Noble Sacrifice won't be spectacular, and the other ones will be garbage as usual.\n\nI'll agree that Shadowy Archer is too strong; do you think making it a 1/2 would be fine (still better than Creeper, but it is a class card)?\n\nFor the Tortoise, it does seem limited, but I think in a deck with a lot of card draw, or a deck that can afford to blank on several draws, playing 2/2s over and over and over again will eventually just win you the game. A comparison could be made with Hogger in terms of how 2/2 Taunts can snowball out of control. Also it's a Beast, though I don't know how useful that is.\n\nI didn't consider the Shade comparison with Fel Imp at all, I think its advantage is that it can grow much quicker, when making it I was thinking of the synergy with Floating Watcher; you tap and simultaneously grow both of them at once. Also with Blood Imp on board he grows faster than Shade as well, although not by much. He's probably a much worse play in the early game, but I think when you can play him and a few health-buffing effects immediately he shines.\n\nFor Neighborhood Blacksmith, I think the problem with him is that in order for him to be good you have to have a lot of weapons, but then you can't use them all because you have a ton of durability on the one you have. And if you only get a few more charges, then he's pretty comparable to Greenskin;  with 1 minion, he's just worse, with 2 it's arguable (+1/+1 on the weapon but -2 Attack), so it takes 3 minions on board for him to be a better Greenskin. Which for current Warrior decks isn't that easy to achieve.\n\nThanks again for the response!","link_id":"t3_2qq3wf","name":"t1_cnas9k3","score_hidden":false}

You can make tight rules with an unbalanced system, or a balanced system with not tight rules.\n\nIf it was about balance, well, warmachine/hordes is one system that supports 14 full factions, and warhammer 40k has 18 (really about 16 if you dont include some armies that are meant to be allies and not full factions).  fantasy doesn't have to be balanced against 40k so it's not included.  So the difference isn't so great.  unless you think the jump from 14 to 16-18 factions really breaks the camels back there, but i cant see it.\n\n\n\n\nBut back to the tight ruleset -  warhammer 40k's main rules problem isn't the vast number of rules.  It's not the minute rules interactions.  Really the core problem is the rules aren't written in a systematic fashion.\n\nA systematic rule set lays down terms and uses them to create a complete and bounded system.\n\n40k has decided not to go this route and elects not to fully define terms most of the time, and often uses many similar terms with slight differences to mean the same thing, leading to confusion.\n\n40k rules are written when the rules writer has an idea in mind and jots down what he thought in plain english.  Most games with tight rulesets has the creator think of a rule, then they write it down in the confines of the rules set.\n\nTo use an example earlier today - \"a single passenger can fire out of each Fire Point\".  This is a poor rule as it stands, because the timing is not defined, and 40k doesn't even have a definition for what firing means.  do you \"Fire\" psychic shooting attacks?  Are you firing once or twice if you shoot two shots from the same weapon?  are you firing twice if you shoot two different weapons?\n\nA tighter defined rules set would have defined \"fire\" as making a ranged attack, and ranged attacks as psychic, shooting, etc.  It would let you know if that is per phase or per turn or per firing step or what the timing is.\n\nTo use an example from a comprehensive ruleset, in magic there's a card that makes all blue lands produce an extra mana.  In 40k it might very well be a psychic power that reads \"All blue lands produce an extra mana\".  \n\nThat would be a terrible rule.  produce is not defined, it doesn't say when they make the extra mana (when they produce, do they produce two?  do they produce one now and one at the normal time?).  Theres just a lot of problems with that wording, you know this without even playtesting it.\n\nThats why magic words it \"Until end of turn, whenever a player taps an Island for mana, that player adds Blue to his or her mana pool\"   The timing is defined, tap is a defined term in the rules, everything about the rule uses defined terms and fits perfectly into the ruleset.\n\nJust reading through different games' rulesets, you can instantly tell by their format and terminology if they were designed to be a comprehensive system or a just descriptions of different things the author envisioned. 40k reads like someone explaining the game to a friend, not a set of comprehensive rules you can make a complete system from.  It's not the minor interactions that come from having so many rules, it's the way they are written.\n","created_utc":"1420070442","downs":0,"parent_id":"t1_cnapvp0","subreddit":"Warhammer40k","edited":1420071036,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rr81","controversiality":0,"gilded":0,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1425124274}

It's to get ahead of the driver plain and simple. \nThe typical argument I hear on Reddit is how we should just stay in the lane so people in cars don't get held up from us passing. \nFirst off, fuck anyone who says that. It's fucking selfish. \nIf I'm going 65mph on flat ground and another driver is going 64mph I'm going to go around him because I want to keep going 65 and not 64 just because people driving a car can't wait a minute while I pass someone. \nIf the guy I'm passing does 64mph 11 hours a day he will do 704 miles. If he does that 5 days a week for a whole year that's 183,000+ miles per year that he's doing. \nNow I come along doing 65mph. Which using the same math I cover 2,000 more miles a year than him. \n\nOn a typical day with my current outfit I make about $250 per day doing about 350 miles. So since I'm covering 11 more miles than him a day but I get stuck behind him doing 64 that means I'm losing $250 per month. \nNow he doesn't directly cause this loss of income because he's just trucking along minding his own business. But I'm losing money by going slower because I get less loads done per year going slower than I usually go. \nSo regardless if someone is approaching I'll swing around him, get back up to speed, pass him and then move back over. And then you can go by no problem. \nAdditionally, I don't want to stare at the back of a trailer I know I can pass. Anyone can agree with that. \n\nIf you made it this far then that's good. Haha\n\nA Truck driver is on the road for weeks at a time. We deal with every kind of driver. Some are kind and considerate. Some are giant dicks almost accidents. Most are inconsiderate pricks who think that their time is more precious than mine. \nWe're all out here trying to make money and get somewhere safe. \n\nThanks for reading. Be safe today.

I don't know if this is common with INTJs but I don't feel very close with people I only know online. If someone online tells a sob story, I'll probably say something sympathetic just to be polite and I feel sorry for them just like I feel sorry for someone I read about in the news who's suffering, but I don't actually care like I would about someone I'm close with. INTJs take a while to warm up to someone, we tend not to have a lot of close friends. It sounds like you're expecting a high degree of emotional connection from someone who might just see you as an acquaintance or casual friend because he doesn't know you well enough yet.

The biggest issue I have with getting back into the game is working out, 'do I go back to my old characters or do I start over' and the biggest and toughest question with that is where to go and what to do to find other players and what to do to make friends.\n\nBeing away for so long and seeing the game as quiet as it is I just log on once in a while and roll about doing dailies (the very reason I left). And I don't even know if I'm gaining anything by that if I end up starting over on Exile side or the other server.\n\nIt upsets me that no one wants to put this information anywhere or even respond to asking questions.

It always seemed to me that Adele wanted to push the responsibility of Olive onto Caden, yet when she leaves, she takes Olive with her. Almost as if she's enjoying the fruits of Olive's childhood, but leaving Caden to eat the rest. Further is the idea that Olive is in fact an extension of Caden, Adele can never escape Caden as long as Olive is with her, which to me comes back to the scene where Olive is afraid of the blood inside her. Caden tries to tell her that yes, she has blood (he wants to feel a bit of himself is in Olive), but Adele tells Olive that she doesn't have blood (saying Caden is not in Olive) which allows her to escape from Caden, with Olive, and not feel like, or able to deny, that Caden's work still lingers in the form of Olive.","created_utc":"1420070460","downs":0,"author":"Nezzatic","score":2,"archived":false,"distinguished":null,"id":"cnas9xx"}

The gems on the other hand, I don't really see them as useful or exciting to anyone except those who have invested extremely heavily in Steam trading.  If you run the conversion rates it's almost always advantageous to sell your cards to Russian money launderers instead.\n\nI hope they get around to doing something different with the sale items you get too.

Please forgive me. I made up my own warning message.\n\n\nJake awoke to the rumbling sound of helicopters flying low over his house. Sitting up slightly and squinting through the haze of sleep, he looked at the clock on his nightstand. Instead of the glowing red numbers, there was only darkness. Then he checked his watch.\n\n3:54 AM.\n \nWith a sigh he dropped back onto his pillow causing his wife to stir and mutter something unintelligible. Just then a searchlight swept across his yard illuminating his bedroom windows before moving on.\n\n\u201cFucking Mondays.\u201d He said aloud. Beside him his wife continued to sleep soundly despite the continuing noise. He rolled over and put an arm around her, smiling as he snuggled close to her warmth, envying her ability to sleep through anything. \n\nThen, over the drone of rotor blades, an announcement sounded in an amplified voice. \u201cA state of emergency has been declared by the United States government. Power and electronic communications networks are down. For your safety, everyone is ordered to exit your homes, remain on your front lawn and await further orders.\u201d The message began to repeat.\nWhat? He thought, utterly confused. Everyone has to go outside? What\u2019s going on? Begrudgingly he arose and walked to the window as a spotlight swept his house again. Down the street he could see several military vehicles as well as a few patrol cars with red and blue lights flashing. Several of his neighbors were already on their lawns looking sleepy and bewildered in their nightclothes. Then he noticed what looked like a greyhound bus being loaded. \u201cWhat the?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it honey?\u201d Sue asked having finally awoken and sat up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. The police and the military are down the street and they are ordering everyone outside. It looks like they are loading people onto a bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe military? A bus?\u201d She sounded incredulous. Then she heard the announcement amidst the cacophony. \n\n\u201cA state of emergency has been declared by the United States government. Power and electronic communications networks are down. For your safety, everyone is ordered\u2026\u201d it continued. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming up the street!\u201d Jake said. \u201cThey just kicked in Rob Merkele\u2019s door!\u201d His pulse quickened.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing what?\u201d Sue asked, still not fully awake.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re dragging his family outside!\u201d \n\n\u201cWho? The police?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe military!\u201d He turned from the window to face Sue. \u201cFuck this. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d She asked.\n\nHe pulled the blinds back again but didn\u2019t answer. The windows were shaking from the helicopters. \u201cThey just kicked the Hampton\u2019s door in!\u201d\n\nBy now Sue had gotten out of bed and was standing beside Jake looking out of the window.\n\n\u201cGet the kids up and get them in here.\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Said Sue and ran from the room and down the hall, turning lights on as she went.\n\nTwo more houses and they would be here. What to do? What to do? He thought about hiding places within the house. The attic. The back of a closet. The trunk of their car. Nothing was right. Should he just go along with this?\n\nSue came back with their two children Tom, 5, and Emily who was 7. They were on their feet but still mostly asleep. \n\n\u201cGo grab a bunch of their clothes and any medicines they may need. We\u2019ve only got a few minutes. They are almost here.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat to do? What to do?\u201d He kept asking himself aloud. Must he go along with whatever this was? How could they get away? Scanning his memory of the area, he remembered a drainage ditch beyond his property in the back yard that ran into a large tunnel. It was a chance.\n\nJake ran out of the room to find his wife. \u201cSue? Sue?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d The sound came from Emily\u2019s room. \n\n\u201cSue! Quick, get them dressed as best you can and shoes on their feet, we are going to try to get out by the drainage tunnel behind the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe drainage tunnel? Is that safe?\u201d She asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our only chance.\u201d\n\nShe was still doubtful. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on. They may shoot us if we run. And if we do get away what then?\u201d\n\nIt was obvious how scared she was as she was standing there in her nightgown, bundles of clothes in her arms.\n\nThere was a hard knocking at the front door. They both jumped at the sound. \u201cOpen up! Open the door!\u201d Pound! Pound! Pound! There were several voices. \u201cEverybody on the street now! Open up. Open the door or we will break it down!\u201d Pound! Pound! Pound!\n\nThe look in her eyes as she shook her head no told him all he needed to know. She wouldn\u2019t be running anywhere with the kids. For a moment they just stood there looking at each other in the midst of the chaos. Pound! Pound! Pound!\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d He said, and walked to open the front door.\n\nThere was a large crash as the door busted open. The cops or military men, he couldn\u2019t tell, streamed inside. They were dressed in all black and their weapons were at the ready. \n\n\u201cPolice! Police!\u201d they yelled as they progressed through the house. They came upon his family huddled on the bed in Jake and Sue\u2019s bedroom.  \u201cEverybody on the floor! Everybody down! Get on the floor!\u201d\n\nJake was in front of his family, his arms spread wide covering as much of them as he could.\n\n\u201cOn the fucking ground now!\u201d The point man yelled. His weapon was pointed at Jake\u2019s head where a red dot now bounced and jiggled. \u201cDo it now! Do it now!\u201d\n\nJakes heart sank. He was powerless. Here were a bunch of armed men threatening his family and all he could do was shield them with his body. Both of their children were sobbing as his wife held them.\n\n\u201cOn. The. Fucking. Ground. Now!\u201d The point man shouted. The other men behind him were now coming in and shouting orders and pointing their weapons. The point man grabbed Jake\u2019s wrist and yanked him off of the bed, throwing him to the ground and putting a knee in his back. The second man in grabbed his wife\u2019s wrist pulling her to the ground causing her to scream.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Jake shouted, pulling his head as far off of the ground as he could trying to see. \u201cStop hurting my wife!\u201d His arm was grabbed, twisted behind his back and a handcuff was snapped around his wrist.\n\n\u201cStop resisting!\u201d the man on top of Jake yelled.\n\nA third man came into the room, grabbed his daughter and threw her to the floor. She yelled as he did so and began crying loudly.\n\n\u201cStop you motherfuckers!\u201d Jake yelled. \n\nThe person on top of him put an elbow into his face. \u201cShut up and stop resisting!\u201d He twisted the other hand around his back preparing to cuff him. Spurred on by the cries of his family and without thinking, he tried to roll over but had no leverage. This prompted another elbow to the face. He tried throw the guy again. This time his left leg found purchase against the nightstand and he pushed. \n\nUnder normal circumstances there would be little chance of anyone bucking a trained fully grown man off of their back, but this was a father protecting his family. A split second of superhuman strength was all that was needed to send him flying against the dresser. Flailing, the cop or whoever grabbed at a partially open drawer as he fell and brought the dresser down on top of himself. Jake, now on his feet, barely avoided the falling dresser as he lunged for the person on top of his wife at the foot of the bed.\n\nHe had his knee in the back of her neck and was preparing to cuff her when they made contact. Both went rolling. Jake ended up on the bottom. The man threw several punches and landed a few on Jake\u2019s face, then paused and reached behind himself. Jake took a swing at the man\u2019s face but his fist missed. The free end of the half fastened handcuff did not. It struck the man squarely in the cheekbone, making solid contact enough to break the bone and send blood pouring from his nose and cut onto Jake. That sent the man\u2019s hands to his face as he let out what would have been, if not for the circumstances, a comically effeminate scream. Jake did not notice. All he knew was that the man was no longer trying to fight. Another swing and the handcuffs connected with his temple silencing him.\n\nJake struggled to his knees, pushing the man off of him and got to his feet. The other person clearing the house, hearing the struggle, now made his way down the hall and into the room. Seeing his one comrade holding his blood covered face and the other struggling to get a dresser off of him, he went into kill mode. He raised his weapon and pulled the trigger as Jake came at him. The sound was instant and sharp, quickly reducing the noise of his kids crying, the helicopters outside, everything, to a high pitched ring.\n\nJake did not feel the bullet pierce his midsection right below the sternum, was not aware of the .223 round\u2019s tumble as it ripped through flesh and guts, spilling bile and blood where it should not go. Jake was only aware of the man in front of him at as his momentum carried them both to the floor. This time Jake was on top. Rage consumed him. Viciously he punched the man, trying to destroy him, his very existence. Over and over his fist made contact with the man\u2019s face, nose, mouth. Teeth cut his knuckles which began to bleed. Blood splattered everywhere.","created_utc":"1420070464","downs":0,"score":1,"author":"BuggerSandwich","id":"cnas9zy","distinguished":null,"archived":false,"score_hidden":false,"name":"t1_cnas9zy","link_id":"t3_2qwwye"}

A family of a deceased business owner approached me and asked me to buy the business for what seemed to be a cheap rate.  I figured it had enough revenue to cover the purchase cost and some goodwill from being so old (founded in 1985) and the customer list and registration to do business with the government.\n\nThe company served the clients mentioned - mainly selling blank video tapes for security cameras.  That's pretty much what the business did.  One of the Atlantic Financial employees had plans to make it into more of a broad consulting company but we didn't.   \n\nThe company continued those services for a couple years as the contracts wound down and never worked in those areas again.  We considered pursuing some government business but didn't.  The company never asked for or got any new government contracts and the one part time employee who was on board with the aquisition moved on -- the internal employee working on it moved on.   The small amount of revenue that came in covered most of the costs of the purchase.  \n\nI had thought that the business might have had value since it is a service disabled veteran business and I'm a disabled vet -- but I never used that certification or pursued those lines of business.  It's really not my cup of tea.  I had also considered using the business as a vehicle to help out a freind who is a martial arts trainer who had trained military and police - so he could run contracts through the business since it was registered in all the databases needed to do business with the government but it was too much effort relative to the reward.\n\nWe scrapped all the inventory, delisted all contracts with all government agencies and turned the shell of what was left into basically a catch all for web development and domain names we are afflicted with.   The company took on a couple small web consulting clients in later years.\n\nAt the time -- 2004 or so, I was not as adamantly against the government as I am now.

I would also like to add that you should try to get an entry level position case managing or residential facility or some other social service agency in order to really get the feel of this work. Maybe volunteer somewhere? This will also help you when you apply for grad school. Social work is a very, very hands on job.

My spring traps have launched more giants than my defenses have killed. The big bomb? Idk... I had extra wall pieces there like next to my cc but WB's haven't been a problem at all. Mass giants or mass archers have been the biggest threat. They drop em to take out that AD knowing they'll also take a crack at that vital \"exposed\" wall piece.

Running lean is a vague term. You have a temperature peak around the st\u0153chiometric of the fuel. The peak begins before lambda and ends after lambda. The danger here is that running a tad bit leaner than lambda will increase combustion temperature. If you continue to lean, there will not be enough fuel to produce heat thus the peak goes down. \n\nWhat I am saying is that it is difficult without proper engine monitoring to determine if you are passed the heat peak or not. CHT temp is critical IMHO. because the head gets less oil and is only cooled by air, the only other way to keep it cool is to run richer. The unburnt fuel will drop the combustion temperature at the cost of producing more undesirable by-byproduct. \n\nThe only fuel that I know that will burn hotter when richer is the Diesel and alike (jet fuel and such).

The important factor is its controlled by the bot itself and likely has absolutely no relation to where the bot is located in real life.\n\n&gt; how the reason why nothing has been solved yet is because there is nothing to solve\n\nPlenty of things have been solved, take a look at this list: \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/wiki/posts\n\nSome of them are not yet completely solved however eventually they will be. It is clear that the owner of the bot is aware that we are solving these codes and are specifically putting out puzzles - hence why theres no way its used to test reddit. \n\nIf youre wondering why the bulk of it isnt being solved is because its not yet possible. There are clues in the easier puzzels which give information on how to solve the main bulk. The working theory is those messsages you see being posted constantly are actually part of groups and are more than likely encrypted. There is no way of outright breaking the encryption (or incredibly low chance) so we rely on solving the other puzzels to even be able to think about trying to solve those. \n\n&gt;there might just be a certain pattern to the random strings generated (e.g on letters a-f are included)?\n\nThe pattern you are seeing is HEX encoding. Essentially hex is any 0-9 A-F (Where A = 10 and F = 16).

{"body":"Absolutely liquidate. Our bank's PB is not in the business of taking a hit/loss because we let a client blow through their margin. This is the response to the asset declining significantly in value, not necessarily the same thing as \"rates rising\".  There is also no guarantee a firm will pay its obligations on the debt (especially on jr unsecured or other lower priority tranches). In the event of catastrophic failure of a credit portfolio, the hedge fund can declare bankruptcy, wipe their hands clean, and owe us nothing beyond the liquidation value of the fund (and at 5x leverage, \"catastrophic\", where we could potentially incur a loss, would be a 20% hit in equity of the portfolio). Any deficit between that and the margin they posted would be our bank's loss.  Likewise, if they were to walk away from a negative margin equity portfolio, it could potentially take days (or weeks) to liquidate positions of a hedge funds size.  During this time, the liquidation could accelerate the market to move against the assets thus forcing greater losses on the bank.\n\nThis is why liquidity considerations are part of the margining methodology. In stocks we look at multiples of 100x avg daily trade volume. With credit we're concerned with % of outstanding issuance as well as # of available executable pricing sources (from appropriately sized dealers) and frequency of those broker quotes. \n\nThis generalizes your question though. Credit portfolios don't inherently suffer when rates rise. There are plenty of floored and variable coupon and step coupon corp bonds out there that are intrinsically lower duration.

It's to stop people who can't afford to consume the legal vodka from purchasing illicit supplies.\n\nThe government in the past decade has been increasing taxes on it and implementing stricter rules. It's reduced consumption and deaths by a third so far. However the downside to this is that illicit vodka is becoming more common for those who can't afford the prices.\n\nThis has been a problem for some time now.\n\nhttp://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/07/17/russias-vodka-tax-backfiring/\n&gt; As many experts \u2013 and drinkers \u2013 warned from the start, high taxes on alcohol have driven hard-drinking Russians to seek out cheaper, illegal sources of booze. Vodka makers complain that they can no longer compete with a thriving black market offering cut price liquor and moonshine.\n\nhttp://english.pravda.ru/business/companies/21-11-2012/122882-vodka-0/\n&gt; According to official figures, the volume of vodka sold on the Russian market doubles the amount of produced vodka. In 2011, the statistical difference was 40 percent. Factory counterfeit products, produced in the \"fourth shift\", are available in all cities of Russia and take about one-third of the market - one billion bottles.\n\n\nIt's right for the government to take action on Vodka consumption and illicit production. Russia has sorted it's self out from being the demographic basketcase it was, however there are still to many Russians dying unnecessarily. Unless they can stop police and officials from turning a blind eye on the illicit production, raising taxes won't do much. \n\nThey need to take a more long term approach. The way the UK does when it comes to stopping drinking and driving and smoking. Hard hitting ads, NGOs and youth groups that spread awareness, large alcohol free zones that makes drinking inconvenient and etc.\n\nAt this point it's a societal issue and not something that can be solved by higher taxes.","link_id":"t3_2qxs48","name":"t1_cnasahp","score_hidden":false,"controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4j","edited":false,"ups":6,"retrieved_on":1425124263,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"gilded":0,"subreddit":"europe","parent_id":"t3_2qxs48"}
